# Reproduce the Analysis from @gerard2021double

## Instructions

1. Install the appropriate R packages

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    install.packages(c("hwep",
                       "tidyverse",
                       "ggthemes",
                       "latex2exp"))
    ```


## Other Files

- [alpha_tetra.nb](./analysis/alpha_tetra.nb) is a Mathematica
  notebook that solves for the double reduction parameter given the
  gamete genotype frequencies in a tetraploid population at HWE. 
  This file was used to derive Equation (XYZ) in @gerard2021double.
  The segregation probabilities come from Table 9 of @fisher1943inheritance.
